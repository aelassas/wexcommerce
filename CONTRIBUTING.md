## Getting Started

- **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.  
- **Clone your fork** locally:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/wexcommerce.git
  ```
- **Install dependencies**:
  ```bash
  cd ./
  npm install
  cd ./backend
  npm install
  cd ./admin
  npm install
  cd ./frontend
  npm install
  ```

- **Setup environment variables** according to the [Run from Source Guide](https://github.com/aelassas/wexcommerce/wiki/Run-from-Source) or [Run from Source Docker Guide](https://github.com/aelassas/wexcommerce/wiki/Run-from-Source-(Docker)).  
- **Run the backend development server** to verify your setup:
  ```bash
  cd ./backend
  npm run dev
  ```
- **Run the frontend development server** to verify your setup:
  ```bash
  cd ./frontend
  npm run dev
  ```
- **Run the admin panel development server** to verify your setup:
  ```bash
  cd ./admin
  npm run dev
  ```

## Code Style and Guidelines

- wexCommerce uses **TypeScript** across the stack.  
- Follow **ESLint** rules.  
- Use descriptive variable and function names.  
- Write modular and reusable code whenever possible.  
- Add **JSDoc** comments for public functions and complex logic.  
- Follow existing project architecture and folder structures.  
- For React components, prefer functional components with hooks.  
- Write clear commit messages summarizing your changes.

## Branching and Workflow

- Create feature branches off the `main` branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```

- Keep your branch up-to-date with `main` regularly:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git rebase origin/main
  ```

- Avoid committing directly to `main` or `develop`.

## Submitting Pull Requests

- Push your feature branch to your fork:
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```

- Open a **Pull Request** (PR) against the wexCommerce `main` branch.  
- Provide a clear description of the changes and link any related issues.  
- Include screenshots or logs if your change affects UI or fixes bugs.  
- Ensure all tests pass and pre-commit checks are green before requesting review.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new features or bug fixes.  
- Run existing tests locally before submitting:
  ```bash
  cd ./backend
  npm run test
  ```

See the [Testing Wiki](https://github.com/aelassas/wexcommerce/wiki/Testing) for more details.

## Pre-commit Checks

- wexCommerce uses **Husky** to run pre-commit hooks: linting, type checking, and file size checks.  
- These hooks run automatically when you commit code, helping maintain quality.  
- If any pre-commit check fails, fix the reported issues before proceeding.

## Reporting Issues

- Use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/aelassas/wexcommerce/issues) page to report bugs or request features.  
- Provide detailed steps to reproduce, expected and actual results, and any relevant logs or screenshots.  
- Search existing issues before creating a new one to avoid duplicates.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive in all interactions.  
- Follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/).  
- Report any issues or harassment to the repository maintainers.

Thank you for helping make wexCommerce better! Your contributions are valued and make a difference.

Happy coding! ðŸ’³âœ¨
